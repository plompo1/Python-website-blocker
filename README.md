# Python-website-blocker
This is a python script that closes your browser whenever you open a website like tiktok or youtube to stop procrastinating. If you use this, remember that it will just close your browser window, not just the tab. This means that any data you have not saved will be deleted. The way it works is it looks through all the programs you have opened, and if it finds one that has the browser name you entered in its process name, it will look for the tabs on there, and if a tab has the website name you entered in its name, it ends the task. This also saves new files to save data (so you don't have to enter your browser and the website to block every time), so make sure it's in it's own folder.
