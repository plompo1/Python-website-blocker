# Python-website-blocker
This is a python script that closes your browser whenever you open a specific website. If you use this, remember that it will just close your browser window. This means that any data you have not saved will be deleted. This also saves new files to save data (so you don't have to enter your browser and the website to block every time), so make sure it's in it's own folder.
